        <p>The <em></em> Crocodiles are aquatic reptiles, and among the most feared carnivores on Earth, because of their size, big powerful jaws, and aggressiveness. They are so successful predators â€“ once they were living alongside the dinosaurs. After the <strong>Chicxulub impact</strong>, which happened around 66 million years ago, the <em>non-avian dinosaurs were gone</em> but crocodiles were managed to survive.<strong></strong>.</p>
